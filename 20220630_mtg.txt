multiply mean by # of days for "cumulative" monthly values

more than 10 of missing days can be considered incomplete data for a month (15 days, half of the days)

look for anomalies, missing value analysis. 

develop lin reg to estimate the value from the other gauges, using the one that is closest and where the correlation is the highest

Scattergram to plot relative data to determine correlation coefficient. Is there are clear difference? 
- Different reg for winter/summer storms, and temperature data

Look at temperatures for same timeframe of evap data 76-88
- how do they measure evap?
- plot temp on the same graph to see if a signal in temp appears as well

HOW TO DETERMINE IF TRENDS ARE SIGNIFICANT
Take entire record into 20-30 yr intervals
- t-test, assumptions about the samples, mean and variance are sig diff. (assumes sample is normally dist.)
- ks-test, non-parametric test to see dist. between median. No assumption of distro 
- null hyp - same distro, if less than 0.05 then null is rejected
- monte-carlo: 70 yr of data w/ linreg

uniform vs normal distro: sample from here
